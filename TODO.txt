- rethink "addMessage" popups

/- Allow undo/redo
    - need to figure out macro actions (move/bend/resize)....
    - Redo sometimes creates duplicate of note (??)

- Fix zoom range options
    
- enable redrawing of canvas

- create scrollbars?
- make audioparam smoother

- sometimes notes get moved over before measure 1 ??

- add comments in editor

- integrate copy/paste with clipboard?
- pasting one note doesn't copy its bend

- create channels with preference towards a specific pitch range
- add gliss to midi capabilities
- add error when gliss goes backwards
- add warning if the editor is unable to load

- import midi need to deal with multiple channels
- import midi need to do tempo thing
    
- make open/save menus instead of different buttons

- pitch bend bug in logic?? should i fix that


- GUI buttons
    - add measuremnet tool
    - add settings
    - save settings in local storage
