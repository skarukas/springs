/- Make move action operate upon all notes, selected or unselected in each forest
    /- keep a set that stores notes found in the forest
    /- for each note in selection, if it's not the set then add its tree to the set
/- Make move action update edge display
/- Implement network graph as opposed to tree structure in notes/edges
/- Update edges when a note is deleted (sorta fixed)
    /- Still need to remove edges from editor.edges if they're removed this way
    /- Maybe delegate edge removal to editor?
- How to reset notes when edge is deleted? Reset bend?? Leave bend?
/- Trigger equal division when pressing Enter in the number input
/- Make it so this doesn't trigger the editing view!
/- Allow copy/paste
    /- create function for translating mouseposn into pitch/time
    /- need to be able to copy structures too...
/- Add editable edge intervals


- Make color more visible
- Allow undo/redo
- Fix updateGraphics bug -- dividing JI tritone in 3 doesn't update the high note posn (?)
- Add custom auto-connections
- Some notes are not being deleted correctly (you can hear them in playback)
- Fix intersection for non-rectangles (currently using SVG.checkIntersection which only checks bounding boxes)
- Make it so the shadowpitch changes when changing bend/interval
- Make playback about beats or secs rather than pixels
