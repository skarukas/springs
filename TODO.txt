- Fix intersection for non-rectangles (currently using SVG.checkIntersection which only checks bounding boxes)
- Make move action operate upon all notes, selected or unselected in each forest
    - keep a set that stores notes found in the forest
    - for each note in selection, if it's not the set then add its tree to the set
- Make move action update edge display
- Implement network graph as opposed to tree structure in notes/edges
- Update edges when a note is deleted (sorta fixed)
    - Still need to remove edges from editor.edges if they're removed this way
    - Maybe delegate edge removal to editor?
- How to reset notes when edge is deleted? Reset bend?? Leave bend?
- Trigger equal division when pressing Enter in the number input
- Make color more visible
- Allow copy/paste
    - create function for translating mouseposn into pitch/time
    - need to be able to copy structures too...
- Allow undo/redo
- Fix updateGraphics bug -- dividing JI tritone in 3 doesn't update the high note posn (?)
- Add editable edge intervals
- Add custom auto-connections
